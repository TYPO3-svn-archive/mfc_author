I see no output in the frontend. What could be wrong?
-----------------------------------------------------

1. The static typoscript was included?

2. Check your settings for the author folder (plugin.mfc_author.author_folder) and the position name for the output (plugin.mfc_author.insertObjectPosition).


Which types of content are supported from mfc_author?
-----------------------------------------------------

At the moment you can use mfc_author with pages, tx_news and tt_news entries. You can select the author in the settings of the page/news object, if the author was added before in the sys folder.


I found a bug or I would like a new feature ...
